    <div class="heading">3. Cookies</div>
    <p>To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Platform for our Users, we use "cookies", or such similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the User's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), Mystox has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Mystox’s advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Mystox does not control.</p>
    <p>Mystox's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits the Platform. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Mystox uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Platform to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Platform and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Mystox's visitors come.</p>

        <div>
    <div class="heading">4. Links
</div>
    <p>Mystox also includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Mystox's control. Once the User leaves Mystox's servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location bar on the User's browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from Mystox's own. If the User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information. Mystox is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.</p>
